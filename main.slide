* Introduction

* Bad Infrastructure

- Un-reproducable
- Fragile
- Difficult to maintaine
- Has leprechauns (hand made changes)
- Too many WTFs

* How Not To Cook

- Using various recipes ( have puppet and chef and ansible at the same time )
- Overcook ( you infrastructure code is too complicated )
- Though, that's how pizza was made ( have bread and flavour it with whatever you can find )

* AWS

- Bad ( just EC2 )
- Better ( EC2 goverened by ansible tower / Salt / Chef / Puppet / Whatever
- Good ( ... ? )
- Perfection ( insert meme image here the guy with face )

* CloudFormation

* Furnace

- Using Multiple Furnace files.....[][]

* Why not use X

    - Different usage structure
