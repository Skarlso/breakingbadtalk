* Introduction

* Introductions

* Bad Infrastructure

** Let's define bad infrastructure

- Un-reproducable
- Fragile
- Difficult to maintaine
- Has leprechauns (hand made changes)
- Too many WTFs

* How Not To Cook

- Using various recipes ( have puppet and chef and ansible at the same time )
- Overcook ( you infrastructure code is too complicated )
- Though, that's how pizza was made ( have bread and flavour it with whatever you can find )
